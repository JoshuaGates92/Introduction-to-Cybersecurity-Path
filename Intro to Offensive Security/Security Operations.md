A _Security Operations Center_ (SOC) is a _team_ of IT security professionals tasked with monitoring a company’s network and systems 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Their purpose of monitoring is to:

-   **Find vulnerabilities on the network**: A _vulnerability_ is a weakness that an attacker can exploit to carry out things beyond their permission level. A vulnerability might be discovered in any device’s software (operating system and programs) on the network, such as a server or a computer. For instance, the SOC might discover a set of MS Windows computers that must be patched against a specific published vulnerability. Strictly speaking, vulnerabilities are not necessarily the SOC’s responsibility; however, unfixed vulnerabilities affect the security level of the entire company.
  
-   **Detect unauthorized activity**: Consider the case where an attacker discovered the username and password of one of the employees and used it to log in to the company system. It is crucial to detect this kind of unauthorized activity quickly before it causes any damage. Many clues can help us detect this, such as geographic location.
  
-   **Discover policy violations**: A _security policy_ is a set of rules and procedures created to help protect a company against security threats and ensure compliance. What is considered a violation would vary from one company to another; examples include downloading pirated media files and sending confidential company files insecurely.
  
-   **Detect intrusions**: _Intrusions_ refer to system and network intrusions. One example scenario would be an attacker successfully exploiting our web application. Another example scenario would be a user visiting a malicious site and getting their computer infected.
  
-   **Support with the incident response**: An _incident_ can be an observation, a policy violation, an intrusion attempt, or something more damaging such as a major breach. Responding correctly to a severe incident is not an easy task. The SOC can support the incident response team handle the situation.


### Categories of typical SOC Services
Reactive services refer to the tasks initiated after detecting an intrusion or a malicious event. Example reactive services include:

-   **Monitor security posture**: This is the primary role of the SOC, and it includes monitoring the network and computers for security alerts and notifications and responding to them as the need dictates.
-   **Vulnerability management**: This refers to finding vulnerabilities in the company systems and patching (fixing) them. The SOC can assist with this task but not necessarily execute it.
-   **Malware analysis**: The SOC might recover malicious programs that reached the network. The SOC can do basic analysis by executing it in a controlled environment. However, more advanced analysis requires sending it to a dedicated team.
-   **Intrusion detection**: An _intrusion detection system_ (IDS) is used to detect and log intrusions and suspicious packets. The SOC’s job is to maintain such a system, monitor its alerts, and go through its logs as the need dictates.
-   **Reporting**: It is essential to report incidents and alarms. Reporting is necessary to ensure a smooth workflow and to support compliance requirements.

Proactive services refer to the tasks handled by the SOC without any indicator of an intrusion. Example proactive services carried out by the SOC include:

-   **Network security monitoring (NSM)**: This focuses on monitoring the network data and analyzing the traffic to detect signs of intrusions.
-   **Threat hunting**: With _threat hunting_, the SOC assumes an intrusion has already taken place and begins its hunt to see if they can confirm this assumption.
-   **Threat Intelligence**: Threat intelligence focuses on learning about potential adversaries and their tactics and techniques to improve the company’s defences. The purpose would be to establish a _threat-informed defence_.
